"""
5.	Write a program a program that uses list of words for some adjectives, verbs and places. It then asks the user for a person’s name, a colour and an object and prints out a funny story by choosing words from its lists and using the words supplied, and some basic pre-defined sentences. A run of the code could look something like this:

Please key in a name: Sally
Please key in a colour: Purple
Please key in an object: box

My story: Sally walks down the street carrying a light purple box. Sally sings as she goes because her box is old, but she likes the colour purple. The box doesn’t care.

With clever choices of words to store, you can get some interesting results.
