3.	Write a program to play a guess the number game. First the program needs to generate a random integer number between 1 and 100. It then asks the user to key in a number and checks it to see if they have correctly guessed the number. If yes, congratulate them, otherwise give the user a message to tell them if their guess was too high or too low. The program should loop back to ask for the next guess, until the user is correct. 

Extension 1: count the number of guesses used so far.
Extension 2: limit the number of guesses that can be attempted.
