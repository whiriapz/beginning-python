3.	A landscape gardening firm charges $65 per tonne for topsoil and $25 for the use of a trailer to carry it in. Write a program to calculate the amount paid by customers buying any amount of topsoil they input. This input should be saved in a variable. The output should list the amount of topsoil purchased, the cost of the topsoil and the total cost, with suitable labels so that the user understands the bill.
