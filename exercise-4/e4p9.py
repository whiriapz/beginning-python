9.	Write a program to calculate the circumference and area of circles. Your output should be a table which lists the radius (r) of the circle, the circumference (c) and the area (a) for circles of radius 10 to 100 cm, in steps of 10 cm. The output should look like:

radius		circumference		area
10			61.8				314
20
30

etc
(You can calculate circumference = 2 * 3.14 * radius and area = 3.14 * radius ** 2)
